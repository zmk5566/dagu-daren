This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Â§ßÈºìËææ‰∫∫ (Da Gu Da Ren) is a web-based rhythm game inspired by "Taiko no Tatsujin" and the philosophical concept of authentic creation versus imitation from Han Byung-chul's "The Burnout Society". The goal is to automatically generate beatmaps from audio files using machine learning and provide professional-grade DAW-style annotation tools for manual refinement.

## High-level Code Architecture

The project's structure is organized as follows:

- `songs/`: Contains the original audio and video source files.
- `data/`: Holds data files for processing and gameplay.
  - `beatmap_format_guide.md`: Documentation for the JSON beatmap format.
  - `*/`: Subdirectories (e.g., `xwx-backtrack-n-drum/`) containing separated audio tracks (.wav files).
- `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts for automating tasks.
  - `create_backing_tracks.sh`: A script to automatically generate backing tracks and a clean drum track from separated .wav files.
  - `README.md`: Documentation for the scripts.

## Common Development Workflow

### 1. Adding a New Song

1.  **Obtain Source Audio**: Get the source audio/video for the new song and place it in the `songs/` directory.
2.  **Separate Audio Tracks**: Use an audio separation tool (e.g., Stemroller, Demucs) to split the source audio into individual tracks (bass, drums, vocals, other). Place these `.wav` files into a new subdirectory within `data/`, following the naming convention `<song-name> - <track-type>.wav`.
3.  **Generate Backing Tracks**: Run the provided script to automate the creation of necessary audio assets.
    ```bash
    bash scripts/create_backing_tracks.sh data/<new-song-directory>
    ```
    This will create a `generated_audio` folder containing the backing tracks and a clean `drums.mp3`.

### 2. Beatmap Generation (Next Major Task)

The next core task is to build a system that can:
- Analyze the generated `drums.mp3` file to detect hit timings and types (`don`/`ka`).
- Automatically generate a `.json` beatmap file based on this analysis.

### 3. DAW-Style Annotation Tool (Current Priority)

The next major development phase focuses on rebuilding the annotation interface as a professional DAW-style tool:
- **BPM Detection & Beat Grid**: Automatically detect BPM and display beat alignment grid
- **Auto-Alignment**: Snap existing annotations to detected beat positions
- **Professional Timeline**: DAW-style track layout with precise time navigation
- **Measure Detection**: Find the first measure's starting position based on drum patterns
- **Visual Beat Representation**: Clear visual indication of don/ka positions within measures

### 4. Frontend Development

Once the DAW-style annotation tool is complete, development will focus on:
- Building the game interface.
- Synchronizing audio with the scrolling beatmap.
- Implementing player input and the scoring/judgment system.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Classic ML Beatmap Generation**: Achieved 80% F1-Score using SVM with MFCC features
- ‚úÖ **Manual Annotation Complete**: All don/ka hits manually annotated for training data
- üöß **DAW-Style Annotation Tool**: Planning phase - requires BPM detection and auto-alignment
- ‚è≥ **Game Interface**: Pending completion of annotation tools
